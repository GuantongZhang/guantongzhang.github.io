                    <p class="review-text">Maggie did an outstanding job selling our multi-unit property in Dana Point and was incredibly hands-on throughout the process. She communicated clearly, was extremely responsive, and was willing to be on-site to manage tenant coordination, contractors, repairs, and logistics firsthand—making it possible for us to be largely hands-off while minimizing disruption to tenants. Her marketing was professional and inviting, and she helped vet buyers to ensure we were working with qualified parties. Maggie was also a strong negotiator—her guidance during the offer stage helped us negotiate firmly and fairly and saved us tens of thousands of dollars while keeping the transaction moving smoothly. I would absolutely recommend Maggie to anyone selling, especially if you want a proactive agent who truly takes ownership and gets things done.</p>

                    <p class="review-text">Bought my first house in 2017 with Jie, when I was a student. Bought a seacond house with her in 2019. Both houses bought at good prices. Now I’m a two kids mum and had sold my first house at a very good price. Jie’s professional housing knowledge always gives me the best advice at the right time. I trust her as a professional housing agent, also like her as a friend, through out years I’m flying between many countries and she always helps with issues of my houses! Thank you!</p>

                    <p class="review-text">Jie was a true professional who deeply cares about her clients needs and request. With me being in China and I didn't have the opportunity to meet her face to face, but she understand the requests I had as a mother and the area I would like to be at and she  accomplished that goal without even knowing the type of person I am. I am deeply grateful for what she has done for me. The move for me was stress less and it worked out just the way I planned. But most importantly, after I bought the house Jie continues to check up on me to make sure all is well. I couldn't ask for a better realtor.</p>

                    <p class="review-text">We bought a house through Jie last year November, while we have been looking for almost one year. And Jie has been tremendously helpful through the whole process. Unlike the other agents, who normally push us to go for a house, Jie always states the shortcomings of the houses first, contaminated land, high voltage cable close by, not so good orientations, too dark, too noisy, too close to highway, and etc. Thus, we felt very comfortable when she says “this is house is ok”. Jie is very experienced with the whole process. We are new to the area and Jie helped us a lot understanding the market and the procedures. Since we were living in China, Jie has also sacrificed lots of her personal time to communicate with us due to the time difference. Over all we are super happy about the house that we bought, perfect location, nice orientation, big yard, convenience and very reasonable priced. And thanks to Jie, the whole purchasing went very smoothly.</p>
